# JavaCodeChange5Destinations - A Skill Building Exercise

Welcome to `JavaCodeChange5Destinations` - a project aimed at helping beginners in Java to improve their coding skills. This project involves taking a basic Java Swing application that displays a list of the top 5 travel destinations and modifying it to display different destinations, images, and descriptions.

## Project Overview

The original application displays a list of the top 5 travel destinations, each accompanied by an image and a short description. The goal is to take this base code and modify it to display your own set of destinations. This exercise will help you get comfortable with navigating a basic Java codebase, understanding how to manipulate Swing GUI components, and handling files and resources in a Java project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. The project was developed using JDK 8.
- A GitHub account for cloning the project and making your changes.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/FlickTechCodes/JavaCodeChange5Destinations.git`.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

## Making Changes

1. The main file you'll be working with is `TopFiveDestinationList.java`.
2. You'll need to change the destinations, descriptions, and images to reflect your new locations.
3. Once you've made your changes, you can run the `TopFiveDestinationList.java` file to see your new list of destinations.
